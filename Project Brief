Temperature-regulated closed environment.
Weather/climate agnostic - can be adapted to a variety of climates, and to all 4 seasons.
Minimal (thus inexpensive) land requirements.
Modular.
Expandable.
Portable.
Maximum design simplicity.
Easy assembly/take-down.
Can use salvaged or improvised materials.
